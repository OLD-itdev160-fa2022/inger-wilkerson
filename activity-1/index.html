<h1>Blackened Chicken </h1>
<p><i>Blackened Chicken is an easy dish that's perfect for a weeknight dinner!</i></p>
<h2>What Makes This Dish a Winner</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick &amp; Easy</strong> This is a super fast dish, that’s easy to prepare and cook–just minutes per side. In fact, it’s so quick, you’ll need to select sides that are also quick (or start then early).</li>
<li><strong>Fun &amp; Flavorful</strong> It was a unanimous three thumbs up at dinner. My “spice-averse” husband was pretty tentative when he took his first bite, but in the end really enjoyed it. In fact he ate the 4th serving without batting an eyelash.</li>
<li><strong>No special ingredients</strong> The spices are all common kitchen spices and the only other things you need are PAM or oil and chicken.</li>
</ul>
